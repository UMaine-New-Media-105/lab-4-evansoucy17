Lab 4 Assignment 1- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/25jU-xFli
  -I made three functions that allowed three different shapes to be created. I used my own functions to create a circle, square and triangle. This was fairly simple becuase I added on to this code in the next assignment. That is why this is devoid of color and so plane. Once I figured out the functions there was no real problem.

  -I added code to allow RGB color's to be added into the function. There weren't any major problems. At first I wasn't completly sure where to put the RGB colors but once I figured that out and played around with the factors I was able to solve the problem. I learned how to better use the RGB color system and how to tweak the values to get different color.

  -I created a function that when the mouse is not pressed there is a frog sprite but when the mouse is pressed there is a clone trooper. This was created for a lab. For a long time both sprites were showing up at the same time becuase I did not have a background. That took a long time to figure out and becuase of that I reorganized the code many times. I learned how to be careful and re read my code carefully to make sure everything is working.
